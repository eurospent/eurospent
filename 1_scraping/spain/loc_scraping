Tried solutions:
- tried to match locations by files -> impossible, too random, too much work, maybe 1-2 file has some rule, but random results too
- needed to separate the steps, because it was really slow
- unaccent on bose side 
- tried match with ILIKE '%loc_name%' - too many results, mid text matches
- extended matches for project name too
- generate new rule based location names (separate by ',') - needed becuase the original lau name was unusable
- tried to filter the matches by nuts2 - lot of missing result, plus still wrong matches
- tried complete worrds with new rule based matches with ILIKE  (beging of the text followed by space, befare after space, end of the text followed by space)
- extended the prvious matches with bracket rules -> still random matches
- filterd the results by nuts2, and for ERDF (ESF too many names)
