The various initiatives in this programme are aimed at different client groups and therefore the success rates will vary considerably between, for instance, thus pursuing basic skills and those pursuing an advanced traineeship. However, it is generally estimated that at least 65% will complete their training successfully and become certified. It is also intended to ensure that at least 18.7% will go on to participate in further training and or find employment on completion.","The Employability Programme incorporates a collection of initiatives that are being proposed by the corporation to satisfy the needs of different client groups to further develop their skills and competencies tied to employability. It will aim to satisfy the following clients needs: 1. for persons with little or no skills or qualifications - the provision of basic, remedial skills and vocational training in a particular occupation will help individuals to take on further learning opportunities and hence become employable; 2. for those in employment interested in upgrading their skills will be assisted through the skills upgrading and retraining programmes. These programmes will be organised in vocational areas for which there is a labour market need. The resultant effect of such training is twofold, it will help those in employment, especially those in the lower end of the qualification structure to sustain their position in the labour market and further more it will contribute towards Malta's competitiveness rate. 3. the Jobseekers - through this programme, training sessions on job seeking skills (letter, CV writing, and interviewing skills) will be delivered on a regular basis. The aim of these sessions will be to empower and activate job seekers and as a result be in a position to seek sustainable employment. In addition, to these sessions workshops will be organised to help those needing additional assistance and with whom we would need to adopt a more personalised approach; 4. for job seekers - traineeships that would include a combination of on-the-job and off-the-job training will be provided. Traineeships will be provided in occupational areas in which there is a demand. These schemes have proved to be very successful as participants are exposed to real life situations at employers' establishments; 5. persons interested in being accredited for their prior learning - a number of occupational standards will be developed in consultation with employers and assessments sessions will be undertaken. This is in line with the proposals being made by Malta Qualification Council; 6. assisting persons to attend training programmes (not organised by the corporation) which will equip them with the right skills which help them to adapt to the changing needs of the labour market - financial assistance will be offered."

Since it was set up 20 years ago, the Water Services Corporation has continued with this development so as to optimise water quality, rationalise operations and control leakages.The sources of supply of potable water of the Maltese Islands are the mean sea level aquifers and desalination plants which in turn supply 43% and 57% of the potable water requirements respectively. These sources are made up of: 85 Boreholes and 9 Pumping Stations through which water is extracted from the aquifers; and 3 Desalination Plants working on the reverse osmosis process. Water from these sources is generally pumped to 24 reservoirs where the water is blended and distributed to customers through gravity systems or pump systems for the higher level areas. This configuration, together with an undulating topography characterising the Maltese islands, leaves the water supply system highly dependent on a series of pumping operations which vary from simply extracting water from groundwater sources to pumping water through the various stages of the reverse osmosis process. This situation makes the Water Services Corporation one of the major power consumers in Malta.In order to supply its customers with good quality potable water at the least possible cost and in an environmentally sustainable manner, the WSC has to ensure that the ratio of water produced from its sources forms the cheapest possible blend. This obviously has to be carried out without jeopardising the quality of the blended water in the reservoirs and also maintaining a sufficient level of reserves throughout the island. Also, within the scope of attaining this, water needs to be transferred from one reservoir or source to another, so as to guarantee that the final blend has the right quality parameters to meet all potable water standards. The Corporation is thus continually striving to optimise its operations to maintain a balance between water quality and power consumption while at the same time satisfying demand requirements.The Corporation is also committed to continue improvements through the maintenance of a certified ISO 9001 quality management system and the implementation of an ISO 14001 environmental management system. The Corporation adopts the DWD in order to monitor and control its water. It houses ISO17025 accredited tests within WSC’s laboratory which not only serves as its internal quality control but also acts as a regulator to all its operations related to water quality including operational investigations and projects pertaining to improvement in quality of water. The WSC is also committed to introducing a Water Safety Plan in line with WHO guidelines. Through this project the WSC is seeking means to improve its operations in different sectors of its potable water supply. The measures making up this project are interlinked and complementary to each other such that they ultimately contribute towards the improvement of operational efficiency and providing a better service to the customer.This project falls under Priority Axis 5 of Operational Programme I which outlines the objectives for Cohesion Policy. This Priority Axis identifies the following goals which are relevant to the project:• To reduce airborne emissions from electricity generation• To promote the use of RES and energy efficiency and reduction in the use of non-renewable energy sources.","1. Better quality water in parts of the network which will directly affect over 50,000 consumers (refer to Section 5.10, Target Groups) by ensuring that the level of boron of water produced at RO plants and distributed directly to consumers is kept within the 1mg/l stipulated in the DWD;2.

These historic ramparts from an integral part of the Maltese landscape and are also important architectural and cultural monuments in their own right. Most of our tourism product is sold around the unique iconographic and visual power that these monuments provide. These fortifications are, and have been for a very long while, a core feature of the Maltese tourism product that is widely used to publicise the island's assets on all tourists brochures. Yet, despite their inherent historical and architectural significance, and importance to tourism, the larger parts of these historic ramparts are to be found in a very poor state of preservation, owing largely to the inability, to date, to address the line scale and magnitude of the task of restoring such massive works and more importantly, the inequality of the limited resources that have been available so far as to maintain and repair these extensive works. Owing to their present consumed and decayed state, therefore, these prime and highly visible fortifications are both visually unattractive and as such do little to promote Malta's brand image and claim as a cultural destination. It is to be stressed that in various places the poor state of the fortifications serves as a cause for ridicule and concern owing to the high degree of erosion, vegetation, structurally instability, misuse and treat to public safety, when instead, those historical ramparts should be a source of national pride and identity. The effort that s necessary to redress this state of affairs can only materialise with the assistance provided by ERDF support. The project for the restoration of the fortifications of Valletta, Birgu (with parts of the intra-mural spaces), sections of the fortifications of Mdina and the Gozo Citadel is designed to bring these important cultural and touristic sites back to an acceptable standard of presentation, whereby they will once again require their due attractiveness, dignity, architectural legibility and visual power, important aspects that have suffered considerably over the past decades. The investment provided by this project will upgrade the quality of the fortifications as prime tourism sites. The proposed restoration works, once completed in their totality, will also serve to recuperate various areas currently unutilised and make them available for culture activities or their purposes, thereby adding to their overall rehabilitation and greater integration into the tourism product that the Maltese islands have to offer. The project will help revalorise the image of the fortifications and allow Malta to retain its competitive edge in the cultural tourism sector. The project's impact on tourism, and on the overall economy in general, therefore, will be largely at the macro level, since the restored fortifications will enable a better image of the tourism product that the country already has on offer.","The main primary and underlying concern in promoting this project has always been the restoration of the decaying architectural fabric of the fortifications (135,000 metres squared of restored rampart elevation). The most important result is that the fortifications, once restored, will once again regain their architectural and cultural integrity befitting prime cultural-tourism sites; integrity that has been diminished over the years owing to the processes of decay, urbanisation, and pollution brought about the various factors. The restored fortifications will provide renewed opportunities for revalorisation and reuses by other stakeholders. In many ways this project is akin to the repair of an extensive, but rundown, network of arterial roads once repaired, these would improve traffic flow, reduce accidents and ultimately facilitate commerce. The possibility of offering tours around the fortifications should be pursued in the future, however, it can only materialise after the fortifications have been repaired and restored in their totality, and not during the duration on the project both for safety and aesthetic reasons. As such, this and other related activities which will be able to materialise after completion of the project cannot be used to measure and judge the success of the restoration project. The very benefit to tourism that will accrue from this project lies squarely in MRRA ability to restore the very fabric if these fortifications. It makes little sense for a country which seeks to promote its cultural assets, particularly as part of its tourism product) and its brand name when it then presents its prime assets in a neglected and consumed state of repair. As for the improved accessibility that will result from certain aspects of this project, this will be in the form of the recuperation of some of the unused areas of the fortifications in question, including underground passage ways which link the ditches to the interior of the ramparts","The projects intends to achieve the following objectives for each of the four chosen sites: Valletta: The main scope of the project is the restoration of the Bastions and masonry revetments and the scraped bedrock of the main bastioned front of Valletta - a world heritage site - together with its outer screen of counterguards and advanced works. The project also seeks to identify and promote the spaces within the fortifications in such a way so as to maximise the cultural potential of the fortifications. Birgu: The main scope of the project is to restore and rehabilitate the Birgu fortifications, in such a manner as to re-establish the physical connections in the Cottonera area between the Birgu seafront, Bormla and Kalkara seafront. Mdina: The main scope of this project is to consolidate the fragile terrain on which the bastion walls and historic places such as the Vilhena Palace at the entrance to Malta's medieval capital city are built in order to diminish and possibly stop further settlement and damage of these historic legacies. Gozo Citadel: The main scope of this project is to restore and repair the ramparts of the Cittadella and to consolidate the fragile face and medieval ramparts on the northern part of the enceinte."

Historic buildings, structures and spaces have also been restored.",OPI Investing in Competitiveness for a Better Quality of Life ERDF,European Regional Development Fund,To support the upgrading of the tourism product;,PA2 Promoting Sustainable Tourism,OPIPA2 Product Development,"Intended achievements: • To restore and bring back to life historic buildings and structures and to do so in a manner which is financially sustainable. • To convert what was previously a war machine into a machine for tourism, leisure, education and the appreciation of heritage. • To create two outstanding visitor attractions namely a museum and a ramparts walk Endowment to country It is envisaged that these achievements will enhance Malta’s attractiveness as a tourism destination and provide added value to the visitor experience, primarily because the experience provided by Museum and the Walk are authentic in that it will be based on the actual artefacts (i.e. fort, barracks, pillboxes, gun emplacements etc.). The project will help realise the full cultural and tourism potential of the site. Potential bottlenecks or other problems• Delays or cost variations may result if during works, there is a find of historic or archaeological importance. Whereas new information resulting from new finds will be welcome, the additional time and effort that will be required to fully investigate such finds could disrupt cost and timeframes projections.","Existing historic buildings which are currently unused or underutilized will be brought into a viable tourism/cultural use. Buildings currently in use (as a police academy or offices) will be changed to a tourism/cultural use, with the current uses being relocated elsewhere. The following are the areas within existing historic buildings which will be made use of for tourism, culture and related activities. In addition, 490sq.m. display area within the Vendome Battery will remain in use as a display area but will be changed from being the War Museum to the Story of Valletta Museum. (current War Museum artifacts will be relocated and moved into the Military History Museum within the Fort and Enceinte). An area of 8,180 sq.m., which is currently inaccessible to tourists and the general public, will be made fully accessible without charge. This will be the Ramparts Walk which will be along the entire length of the Carafa Enceinte. The new length of walk (or promenade) which will be provided will be 670 metres. (The length of walk given is from point of entry near MCC to point of entry near Vendome Battery (current War Museum). The Walk will be a safe and comfortable urban space with open sea views and free of the intrusion and pollution of vehicles – a space which is currently NOT accessible to tourists and the general public. At the end of the first year of full operation of the Museums and Ramparts Walk (i.e. 2015) , the number of tourists who visit the lower end of Valletta is estimated to increase by 10% compared to today. As at to date it is difficult to say the exact amount of tourists visiting the area because no statistic was carried out. Hence in order to establish these results, tourist surveys will be carried out as follows:• October/November 2012 to establish the baseline. • October/ November 2015 to establish whether the projected increased percentages have been achieved. It is envisaged that for survey purposes ‘lower Valletta’ is the area of Valletta beyond St. George’s Square. It includes War Musuem, Fort St. Elmo Experience, MCC, Malta Experience, Siege Bell Memorial, Lower Baracca Gardens, Casa Rocca Piccola and the areas immediately adjoining them. During the first year of full operation of the Museums and Ramparts Walk (i.e. 2015) , a total of 150,000 people will have walked along part or all the Enceinte. (This refers to people who make use of the site without payment and therefore excludes persons who paid to enter the Musuems.) The computation is derived as follows; for the months June to September, there will be a relatively high number of tourists exploring the area of lower Valletta, partly because of increased tourists’ arrivals to Malta during this period and partly because of the increased number of visits by cruise ships. There will also be more residents of Valletta and other parts of Malta who will visit gardens and public spaces during the evenings in the summer. Hence, for 125 days it is assumed that an average of 600 persons per day will enter the Enceinte (75,000 persons) and for the remaining 240 days (October to May) an average of 313 persons per day will enter the Enceinte (75,120 persons).In order to calculate this result, pedestrian counts will be held at the entrance pointsof the Fort. Paying visitors will be deducted to obtain number of persons who walk along the Ramparts Walk but not have entered the Museum.",N/A

It thus seeks to ensure that the main project target group, as represented by local and foreign tourists, benefit through an enhanced Cittadella tourist experience – an experience which adds visitor value. The project is thus intended to act as a pull factor that attracts more visitors, encourage repeat visits and lead to positive word of mouth publicity of the island by those who visit the site. The implementation of this project would also provide the attractive ingredients for the further marketing of Gozo among cultural tourists thus boosting the economic and social potential of the island by sustainably developing the rich untapped potential of this unique historic site. In so doing it would specifically boost the economic potential of the operators located within the Cittadella and in the immediate vicinity of the site and more generally of the island as a whole.This project contributes to 3 main objectives of the Tourism Policy: The project seeks to ‘maintain and conserve the environmental and socio-cultural resources’ within Cittadella ‘being key elements of the Maltese Islands’ tourism product’, as its major components involve restoration and conservation of cultural assets within Cittadella which contribute to upgrade the Gozo tourism offer. The project also seeks to improve and better present the Cittadella by introducing interpretative facilities, a representation of the way of life of our ancestors via the conversion of the historic house as well as significant improvements in the physical access to the various parts of the site. This effectively means that the project is intended to achieve quality improvements in the tourism product which ‘increase the island’s competitive advantage’. The project will as a result enhance the visitor’s experience, increase visitor value added and act as a pull factor which attracts more and repeat visitors to the site thereby increase tourism earnings and tourism value added’.","The surveys carried out by the Ministry for Gozo in April 2011 amongst 188 foreign visitors and 30 economic operators in relation to this project, also looked into the results being expected following completion of the project on the two aforementioned aspects namely the state of conservation of the Cittadella and the quality of tourist related services being offered. The findings of the survey vis-s-vis the expected satisfaction rate shall constitute the benchmark for this assessment. The survey findings show that as regards the state of conservation of the Cittadella and the tourist oriented services being offered:• Present satisfaction rate of visitors to Cittadella is 42.77% and is expected to increase to 76.6% following the upgrade.• Present satisfaction rate of economic operators is 47.76% and will increase to 83.7% Moreover the economic operators also stated that Cittadella has a lot of potential and if upgraded it will attract more visitors and business to the area from which they stand to gain.It is furthermore believed that the upgrading of the site and in particular of its open spaces will render it more attractive and subsequently result in the organisation of more cultural events within its precincts and in particular within the ditch and Cathedral Square area. The increase in the number of visitors to such cultural events will contribute to the proposed result indicator. This contribution shall be monitored through the booking system for such events. Every year an average of 20 cultural events are held within Cittadella and it is envisaged that such events will increase to 40 following project completion.The satisfaction rate of both target groups will be measured through a survey that will be carried out by MGOZ, through its own finances. This will be undertaken during the summer months and will proceed as follows:In the case of foreign tourists visiting the Cittadella, a random sample of 100 foreign visitors will be selected and interviewed;In the case of the economic operators: the same operators who participated in the earlier survey will be interviewed again during the same period.",

Added ValueWith this health related infrastructural investment service users will benefit in the long term because timely diagnoses of ailments will prevent their future need for hospitalization and acute interventions. Society at large will also benefit from this investment. This is because, through further prevention and early intervention, health will be added to life by increasing years lived free from ill health, reducing or minimizing the adverse effects of illness and disability, healthy lifestyles will be promoted and the quality of life will be improved overall.Current service provisions at Mater Dei Hospital and at Primary Health Care, in relation to medical imaging services, ultrasonography (for both general, gynaecological and obstetrics), vascular applications, prevention of retinopathy in diabetics, large and small bowel diagnoses will make giant leaps through this application, whilst other new services like assessing patients for retinopathy and vascular issues at Health Centres will be introduced, potentially reducing the need for extended hospitalisation and waiting lists at Mater Dei Hospital. Through this Project, Government is expected to incur lower costs in acute interventions whilst meeting the needs of the service users and society at large.This Project is based on the accessibility of care, implementing the fairness and solidarity principles, taking into account the needs and difficulties of the most disadvantaged groups and individuals, as well as those requiring costly, long-term care.The delivery of a better quality of life is another important focus of this Project. Added pressures and different demands on Malta’s health care systems, from ongoing demographic and socio-cultural changes, need to be met and therefore Government is committed to promote and advance the quality and excellence of Malta’s health care services including through the introduction and, or improvement of existing technological modalities. Furthermore, with the enhancement of early screening and prevention programmes, life expectancy and the quality thereof is expected to be ameliorated.Sustainability is another focus of this Project. Despite soaring costs and demand, Government remains committed to preserving the solidarity-based model of universal access to care. Waiting times, a long-standing problem in health care, have an adverse impact on the health and quality of life of patients as well as on their overall satisfaction with the health system.

Introducing new services to make the service provision in Gozo as comprehensive as possible maximising the output of the available expertise thus mitigating the need for referral of Gozo residents to Malta. The new services include vascular surgery, laparoscopic (minimally invasive) surgery, laparoscopic gynaecological surgery, ultrasound and X-ray guided interventions, colorectal cancer screening.3. Ensuring adequate backup for emergencies or having full set of equipment to handle more serious emergencies e.g. having an adequate number of anaesthetic machines both as immediate back-up in case of failure of one of the current machines during operations and also to cope with emergency requirement in case of multiple trauma admissions, or availability of a capnometer for measurement of blood gases especially carbon dioxide in emergencies involving resuscitation of children in cases of drowning, respiratory failure, bronchiolitis, severe asthma and chest infections.4. Avoiding the decrease in the current levels of service provision due to deterioration of equipment since recurrent repairs take items of equipment out of service for substantial periods of time, incurring significant costs and repeatedly effecting the availability of that service until it is totally withdrawn. 5. Benefiting from efficiency gains especially in patient throughput and nursing time. This project will enable patients to be operated over a shorter period of time, more patients to be operated on a single operating list and for patients to have a shorter length of stay. This in turn would release more beds to do more operations/procedures. The equipment meant for facilitating patient recovery, monitoring, transfer and handling would positively affect efficiency and ease of nursing care, increasing FTE’s to allow nursing and patient support staff cope more effectively with increasing patient turnover with the current staff complement. Rapid seamless recovery and rehabilitation of patients also shortens time away from work.6. All these factors will together contribute to a broader spectrum of healthcare services that are safer, reliable and more efficient and available in Gozo. This would be less stressful to the patients and increase the possibility of support from their relatives most significantly after more serious, complex operations and emergencies and facilitate more rapid rehabilitation and social re-integration.","This project had to achieve the following results by 2015:• The number of surgeries in the theatre will increase by 10% unless the proportion of major and complex major surgeries increase to the extent that available theatre time is taken up by them.• The number of endoscopy procedures will increase by around 10%.• Around 120 patients will undergo Laparoscopic Surgery.• More lives saved through earlier detection of colorectal cancer. It is estimated that around 2 lives can be saved and 10 cases of cancer can be avoided by early detection.• It is expected that patients travelling to Malta for surgery and endoscopies will not exceed 2011 figures (1397 patients).• It is expected that the number of patients transferred to Malta by Ambulance or Helicopter for general surgical emergencies will be reduced. This depends on the type of emergency and is difficult to estimate but an average of 5% decrease from 2011 is expected.• New register for Colorectal Cancer Screening and US guided interventions introduced. • Vascular surgeries can be done at GGH and statistics can be captured from the Operation Register already available.

The building provides adequate, safe and comfortable facilities, facilitating teaching/tutorial, research, meeting, and basic restorative faculty activities. The building integrates with and enhanceS the existing University of Malta architectural landscape.",OPI Investing in Competitiveness for a Better Quality of Life ERDF,European Regional Development Fund,To support the re-structuring process of local industry (including crafts) and its move towards a competitive knowledge economy and promote entrepreneurship;,PA1 Enhancing Knowledge and Innovation,OPIPA1 Investment in RTDI and RTDi-related Infrastructure and ICT,"The overall objective of this project is the provision of a state-of-the-art building and facilities for the Faculty of ICT at the University of Malta.There are currently no physical premises at the University of Malta to house and physically represent the Faculty of ICT and its projected growth. This is a serious limiting factor on the activities and growth of the Faculty of ICT as an entity and therefore of its component departments. The overall objective for the project shall be the availability of an ICT Faculty building that shall contribute to the knowledge infrastructure and research capacity within the University. The building will allow the Faculty of ICT to offer high-quality day and evening degree courses at both under- and post-graduate levels, as well as various diploma and training courses.Employment realities indicate that ICT graduates are in strong demand. Students as early on as the second year of the existing BSc IT (Hons) course at the University of Malta are already being engaged and promised posts in various local ICT organisations. Discussion with local industry and associations has, over a considerable number of years, always come to the conclusion that not enough ICT graduates were being produced. The Government of Malta’s commitment to such initiatives as SmartCity and SmartIsland have induced public declarations of graduate needs ranging in the thousands. The University’s output currently stands at about 40 to 50 graduates per year. It is therefore clear that with the current resources at its disposal, the University of Malta, through the Faculty of ICT, cannot hope to help narrow the ICT demand and supply gap.This objective is clearly in line with prevailing Government of Malta policy in terms of social betterment and quality of life improvement recognising ICT as one of the most substantial economic enablers whose growth has to be encouraged - especially in the light of the constantly increasing local and foreign business interest in Malta as a stable, modern and technologically viable partner.","As has already been mentioned, there is at present no ICT faculty buildings, teaching rooms, labs etc, within the University. As has already been mentioned, ICT students have to share facilities that apart from being inadequate in space, it is also totally deficient of the required infrastructure and equipment. The large space that is available (over 7000m2) composed of adequately sized lecture rooms as well as a large number of research labs, are enough to accommodate the present and foreseeable ICT students for at least the next 30 years, whilst the infrastructure should have a lifetime of over 10 years. With a current ICT community of just over 1400 students, and a projected annual student increase of at least 20%, this should amount to over 8600 students over this estimated lifetime.The items being funded include:Construction and Structural WorksElectrical /Mechanical ServicesFinishesFurniture and EquipmentIn terms of concrete room space, no definite count can be issued at this point due to the fact that area will be maintained as flexible as possible to maximise the usefulness of the available space. For this reason, a modern workspace organisation of movable partitioning and open-plan areas possibly combined with “hot-desking” will be adopted. At the present moment the following approximate area details can be given:The construction will consist of four levels.Level -2 This part of the construction includes excavation and site clearance work. (approx. 1700sq m): Underground parking area.Level -1 (approx. 1500sq m): Mainly labs and lecture rooms. Approx. 730sq m lab space and 730sq m lecturing area - the rest taken up by service and utility rooms.Level 0 (approx. 1450sq m): Mainly lecture rooms, labs, meeting/seminar and common rooms. Approx. 750sq m lab space, 440sq m lecturing area, 150sq m meeting/seminar areas, 60sq m office area – the rest taken up by services and utility rooms.Level 1 (approx. 1450sq m): Mainly office space and meeting/seminar and board rooms. Approx. 250sq m meeting/seminar and board rooms, 1150sq m office space – the rest taken up by service and utility rooms.All levels to include necessary stairways, passage ways, elevator systems, emergency exits, and service ducts/shafts.","The purpose of this project would therefore be the provisioning of the Faculty of ICT of the University of Malta with an environment conducive to its current activities and projected growth. In practical terms, this will translate, amongst other things, to the training of ICT professionals for national and international consumption at all the levels of the technological value chain. Another purpose of this project would be to offer the Faculty of ICT the means by which to garner interest in the field of ICT and foster the growth of a healthy ICT research community, thus providing the right environment for effective collaboration between the University of Malta and other academic and commercial organisations.The need for closer, more relevant and effective collaboration with industrial partners is in line with both Maltese and EU directives targeted at the strengthening of R&D procedure and structure. With the introduction of the newly-formed Faculty of ICT. The construction of an adequate and modern Faculty of ICT building will enable the future growth and diversification of ICT in Malta, and the implementation of the Faculty’s ideas and collaboration efforts within the real world - in particular within a forward-looking Maltese socio-economic landscape."

A new covered resevoir will be constructed adjacent to the hangar which is intended to collect run off water from the hangar and nearby areas. This water will be used to water the warious soft areas and garden that form part of the museum's landscaping. One of the key results to be achieved by the project is the long term benefit of preserving our historic aircraft collection for future generations under a roofed area in a fully assembled state, away from the elements of nature.","The project purpose is to enlarge the display area and significantly improve the overall presentation of the exhibition. This is to be achieved through the construction of an additional 1,400 square metres of indoor display area, the re-organisation of the display setup of our collection, creating areas dedicated to different epics of aviation history, the introduction of new user friendly information panels, the introduction of new hands-on walk through experiences and the ability to display many of the foundation's aircraft exhibits that are stored in a dismantled form. Such exhibits will be fully assembled and displayed as complete aircraft. The Malta Aviation Museum Complex will thus be able to boast of a Main Exhibition Hanger of international standard thus making the Museum a greater attraction for cultural and holiday tourists to visit Malta."

Apart from demonstrating and mentoring new staff on the application of these skills and techniques, the qualified staff will be able to guide them on how they can attain further information on the subjects or even how to achieve qualification in them.This project will also address the market failure that exists between the physiotherapy service that is being offered to the Maltese patient population and their European counterparts. Some of these techniques have been implemented within the physiotherapy services overseas but not yet in Malta in both the public and even the private sectors. It will also tackle the existing health inequality issue that exists between patients who can afford private physiotherapy versus those who cannot since some of these skills and techniques are currently only available in the local private physiotherapy sector. Carrying such knowledge across the border from one country to another will most probably generate new questions and ideas on the subjects being tackled possibly spawning new areas for discussion or even further research."

","Flash flood events in Malta involve directly and indirectly all economic, productive and life sectors of the Maltese Island. In general, even if the problem is more acute in certain areas of the island such as the Birkirkara, Msida, Gzira, Marsa and Marsascala catchment areas, the effects spread on all surrounding country engaging indirectly almost all Maltese population (circa. 410,000 residents).The NFRP tackles four different catchments namely the Birkirkara-Msida, Gzira, Qormi-Marsa and Marsascala basins, wherein are found the nine worst-hit localities, namely Msida, Birkirkara, Balzan, Gzira, Qormi, Marsa, Zebbug, Marsascala and Zabbar. These areas are identified among the top priority areas in the Storm Water Master Plan and also represent the areas where the majority of damages occurred in the last major storm that hit the Maltese Islands in September 2003. The NFRP will address flooding problems holistically at a catchment level, and also regionally by managing runoff across catchments. The proposals go beyond the local-problem focus; they address the interconnections between problems in different localities and also seek to connect drainage solutions of adjacent basins together, to achieve greater cost-effectiveness and hydraulic efficiency, while also optimising the scope for future water conservation. The NFRP also addresses the institutional dimension of the problem by including measures to strengthen the existing planning, management and maintenance responsibilities into an identifiable and more formal organisation. It is envisaged that through the implementation of the NFRP a turning point will be brought about in storm water management in the Maltese Islands, at the functional infrastructure level and in the operation and maintenance of the new system."

This is the very first time, that this type of international quality certification is being introduced in local education sector and hence the present baseline would be zero percent. 2) Projects will help schools to attain an average pass rate in SEC examinations and not below the 85% mark, provided that external factors beyond the control of the school do not impinge negatively on this result. The latest tracer studies undertaken by the Ministry of Education in 2009 clearly show that 96.2% of all Church School pupils move on to Higher Education. The current reforms are expected to lower the average pass rate by a factor of 10-12%. It would therefore be reasonable to expect this level of attainment to fall by at least 15-17% to a level around 80%. This would then be the new baseline, the old baseline being no longer valid in view of the drastically altered composition of the new intakes starting September 2011.3) Staff morale will be kept high, despite radical changes, as measured by low staff turnover, lack of industrial action, and job satisfaction of teachers at work.

These reports by the Heads of the participating schools will form part of the certification criteria for the Quality of Award and will be expected to show, through documentary evidence, how class room practice has evolved through the application of skills obtained and homed through the training programme, including ICT skills. By interference, 50% of all Church schools in Malta and Gozo, excluding pre-grade schools will be expected to adopt new teaching approaches. 5) Educators will be enabled to use ICT tools confidently and with ease in order to achieve better student outcomes and not just use ICT as a presentation tool, bearing in mind that ICT tools in the classroom are not equally present in all schools. Unfortunately no data exists to provide a baseline for the use of ICT tools in Church schools. However the project shall be undertaken in tandem with a concurrent initiative to equip all teachers in Church schools with a laptop, enabling them to put the knowledge gained through the tainting programme to good use. Each Head of School would be expected to submit a qualified assessment during the first quarter of 2014on the use of ICT in the class room. This would be corroborated by the independent assessments undertaken in terms of the individual certification and quality award criteria.","1) To identify, promote, design and develop effective teaching strategies for individualised learning; 2) To provide a comprehensive suite of skills, techniques and complimentary management tools for the implementation of inclusive strategies; 3) To enable effective pedagogical us of ICT resources in a multi-sensory classroom environment capable of addressing all learning styles and capabilities."

It is anticipated that a total of 292 adults shall be receiving certification (80% of participants). Table 10 of the Report On Skills For The Future48 tabulates employment rates according to levels of educational attainment. From this table, it was possible to extrapolate the % increase in the employment rate between different levels. It has been noted that this rate stands at 13.4% when a person follows an NQF Level 6 course and 26.1% when a person follows an NQF Level 4 or 5 course. No data could be extrapolated for NQF Level 3 and therefore the same % as used for Level 4/5 has been used. The data used covers the year 2007 so as to correlate with the data provided by NSO which identifies the total number of persons participating in lifelong learning per sector. Estimates provided by NSO demonstrate that the number of adults participating in lifelong learning endeavours in 2007 amounted to 76,023 for all the sectors identified. Therefore it was possible to extract a baseline for each sector tackled by the project.

One-to-one mentoring will be provided to a minimum of 93% of the global amount of participants. This will cater specifically to the needs of the organisations vis-à-vis the drafting and implementation of a diversity policy. 2. It is therefore expected that 60% of participating organisations (i.e. 60% of 70 = 42 establishments) will draw up a Diversity Policy Management. 3. 30% are expected to have implemented the policy (i.e. 13 out of 42). One (1) year from completion a tracer study will be conducted to analyse the tangible results of the project. 4. After project completion the 70% of the establishments which would not have implemented the diversity management policy will be monitored by MTA and encouraged to implement the policy by also looking at best practices already implemented by other companies through a half day seminar. By the end of 2014, 14% of these establishments (i.e. 4 out of 29 establishments) are expected to have implemented the policy. 5. After project completion a re-run training programme will be organised to train a further 30 participants of which 60% (i.e. 18) are expected to have developed a diversity management policy and 30% of the 18 (i.e. 5) are expected to have implemented the policy within their establishments by end of 2015/ beginning of 2016. 6. Increased awareness amongst 5,000 individuals regarding diversity management. The tracer study (to be carried out 1 year after project completion and funded through MTA own funds will look into the participating establishment's commitment to implement diversity practices or enhance their already available diversity practices at their place of work as well as compromising whether there have been any differences in the labour turnover rates, and if the implementation of such practices has been one factor to help attract more people to work with the said establishments.","The project revolves around the concept of 'Diversity Management' which is a rather new concept in this sector. It is active and conscious development of a future oriented, value driven strategic, communicative and managerial process of accepting and using certain differences and similarities in people (example: differences in race, nationality and not just gender) as a potential in organisation - a process which created added value to the company and the workers. Unlike equality, diversity management deals with all the various dimensions of diversity amongst individuals, such as educational background, age, gender, rate, nationality, cultural backgrounds marital status, political belief, disability, work status, corporate culture. Evidently the tourism workforce is nowadays characterised by diversity (example: different nationalities being employed) leading to a workforce of current employees and employers who need to adapt to this reality to ensure that proper services are provided. It is important to highlight that the project is not simply focusing on the element of female participation in the tourism labour market but also takes into consideration the participation of unemployed and inactive persons. This is because employees need to understand each other's and the organisation (corporate) culture and vice-versa to improve the employee-employer relationship. This will help employees to work well together thereby reducing the risk of labour turnover and hence retention of staff. It also helps the relationship between employees and guests since staff will be able to provide a better service to guests of different nationalities and cultures. Through this project, tourism operators will be sensitised to the benefits of utilising diversity management practices as innovative and creative ways of organising work arrangements (e.g.: working conditions, work-life balance, flexi-working, multi-tasking job sharing etc.) thus attracting individuals towards this industry and developing further the potential of those already engaged within the industry but are not optimally operating due to organisational barriers."

This result will be based on those inmates that will attend more then one interview. No feedback forms are currently being made by either ETC or CCF, however this will be done through the courses that will be offered through this project. Questionnaires will be conducted and feedback forms will be distributed before the beginning of the training and another will be conducted 6 months after the provision of the training. This will be part and parcel of the Research and Development phase and the contracted party will be bound through a bid-bond to assure post-project phase questionnaires are conducted and statistical reports submitted. Declaration forms will also be distributed during the course to gauge participation.- 10% of participants will find themselves feeling more comfortable to integrate within the society; Baseline: It is being estimated that approximately 18 persons from the 180 to be trained will find themselves feeling more comfortable to integrate within the society as the social skills course to be given aims to equip the inmate with skills needed by an individual to live in a society. This result has been based on previous outcomes of other courses through administrators who offer courses in prison. No feedback forms are currently being made by either ETC or CCF, however this will be done through the courses that will be offered through this project. Questionnaires will be conducted and feedback forms will be distributed before the beginning of the training and another will be conducted 6 months after the provision of the training. This will be part and parcel of the Research and Development phase and the contracted party will be bound through a bid-bond to assure post-project phase questionnaires are conducted and statistical reports submitted. Declaration forms will also be distributed during the Course to gauge participation.These results will be measured by the researcher together with Paola Local Council, where after the completion of the project, they will be keeping in contact with the participants and will be monitoring the integration process. In this regards, one-to-one meetings will be held with the participants as well as, with family members, between 2 and 6 months after the inmate is released from prison. More than one meeting will be conducted to have a good follow-up. The scope of this project is to ultimately succeed in assisting and helping the targeted beneficiaries to re-integrate as well as to find employment upon release. This measurement process will be made available through reports that will be specifically conducted to establish the progress being made by these beneficiaries. This will be achieved, up to 6 months after the termination of the project. Paola Local Council is the main beneficiary of the reports but the CCF and the University of Malta will have direct access. The Researcher will produce a copy in hard and soft format which will be forwarded to the Project Leader and its distribution will be at the discretion of the partners. The report writing parameters and specification will be clearly drawn up in the Research Tender contract. General Condition: Every inmate may follow during the course application every course once. This will be considered a one-time attempt and logged as such. There may be an intermittent attempt for the same course during the duration of the implementation period. N.B. With respect to the project’s results, the Applicant confirms that there will be participants repeating courses. This is why the number of courses delivered is greater than the number of participants who will be trained.",

This will enable more young people to feel socially included in their school and classroom communities and be enabled to continue their post secondary education, thus preventing future employment difficulties that might be faced by this target cohort.","This project will achieve two aims through one action: 1. It will certify 13-15 fully trained Inclusion Coordinators for Secondary Schools with an M.Ed in Inclusion and Individual Educational Needs (Secondary), ready for filling the recently created post of INCOs in Secondary Schools;2. At the same time, because these will be the first ever INCOs in Secondary State Schools, their training will also entail the first provisions of INCO services during their traineeship and thus also establish the beginnings of the INCO service in at least 13 Secondary Schools. This in turn will also mean that by the end of their 2-year training, these INCO trainees will have (a) ensured that within their schools, all children with IEN will have had formal Individual Educational Planning meetings (around 30 per INCO) as well as the related monitoring of the implementation of the IEPs to ensure each student's progress; (b) It is expected also that within their training period, these INCOs will have started to develop a collection of resource materials for supporting children's learning, and also (c) initiated at least one activity of staff training for inclusive education.","Secondary Schools Management Teams are having difficulties meeting the challenge of understanding and catering for the needs of the increasing number of adolescents with Individual Education Needs and disengaged students. This project for the training of the first Inclusion Coordinators for Secondary Schools will enable the Students Services Department to set up a structure for ensuring the provision and coordination of support for all children at risk of exclusion from meaningful learning. INCOs will provide focus, expertise, commitment and support for whole school development and initiatives for more inclusive education as well as regular support for individuals with IEN."
